### hey, I'm alex 👋

I'm a full-stack engineer and creative 🔮

I've been building for the Apple ecosystem for a *long* time, in Objective-C/C++ and Swift, and for AppKit, UIKit and SwiftUI. I've always been driven to ship polished projects with clean APIs, and back in the day I built [PXSourceList](https://github.com/alexrozanski/PXSourceList) and [PXListView](https://github.com/alexrozanski/PXListView) which shipped in some pretty big apps, including early versions of [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com).

These days I'm excited about Swift, SwiftUI and TypeScript, and am placing a focus on building out fun, interesting projects that make the most of all the incredible tools and technologies that are out there.

I've worked for various companies both big<sup>[1](https://apple.com)</sup> <sup>[2](https://meta.com)</sup> and small<sup>[3](https://codecademy.com)</sup> <sup>[4](https://picnic.photos)</sup>, and I'm currently available for freelance projects 🙌

**If you've ever used any of my open-sourced projects, tips are always appreciated 🙏🏼 and you can also [sponsor](http://github.com/sponsors/alexrozanski) my work on GitHub**
